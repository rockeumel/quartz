xTV3.0
======

This project/try is to create skin as close as possible on the original AppleTV 3.0 interface, including all animations.

To reach that goal it is necessary to use compromises/expedients.

These compromises result in a consume of computing power, so it is not guaranteed that xTV3.0 will run smooth on all devices.
